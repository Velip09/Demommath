To create a personal access token on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Login to GitHub:**
   Make sure you are logged in to your GitHub account.

2. **Access Personal Access Tokens Page:**
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner.
   - Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings."

3. **Generate Token:**
   - In the Developer settings sidebar, click on "Personal access tokens."
   - Click the "Generate token" button.

4. **Configure Token:**
   - Enter a name for your token in the "Note" field. Choose a descriptive name that helps you identify the purpose of the token.
   - Choose the desired scopes for your token. Scopes define the access level your token will have. Be cautious and only select the scopes that are necessary for your use case.

5. **Generate Token:**
   - Scroll down and click the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page.

6. **Copy Token:**
   - After generating the token, you will see it displayed on the screen. Copy the token immediately.
   - **Note: Treat your token like a password. Do not share it publicly, and store it securely.**

7. **Use Token:**
   - You can now use this token as a password when accessing GitHub via Git or other tools that require authentication.

Remember, once you leave the page, you won't be able to see the token again. If you lose it, you'll need to regenerate a new one.

Also, be cautious with the scopes you grant to your token. Only give it the permissions it needs for your specific use case to enhance the security of your account.
