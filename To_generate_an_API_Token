Here's how you can use API tokens:

### Generating API Token:

1. **Log in to PyPI:**
   Make sure you are logged in to your PyPI account.

2. **Access Security Settings:**
   Go to your PyPI account settings. Look for a section related to security or API tokens.

3. **Generate Token:**
   Find the option to generate a new API token. Provide a name for your token, and PyPI will generate a token for you.

4. **Save Token:**
   Save the generated token securely. You won't be able to see it again, so make sure to copy it to a secure location.


Remember, for security reasons, always keep your API token confidential, and do not share it publicly. If there have been any changes or updates to PyPI's authentication methods since my last knowledge update in January 2022, please refer to the [official PyPI documentation](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution) for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
